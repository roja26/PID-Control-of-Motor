# PID-control-of-DC-Motor

To create a remote learning environment for learners which allows them to login
remotely and perform experiments on the hardware.
Our project aims to create short user sessions of 15 minutes , in which a user
can perform experiments remotely and learn about controlled system
To provide real time response for the experiment that the user wants to perform
through graphs and live video.
PID algorithm has steady state error nearly zero to accomplish the designed
criteria of the control system. Therefore, the algorithm works perfectly to get the
desired angular position of DC motor.
